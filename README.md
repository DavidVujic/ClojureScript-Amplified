### ClojureScript. Amplified.

In this repo, you will find examples on how to setup a `ClojureScript` web app with tools from the `JavaScript` ecosystem.

__Want to try out Storybook, without having to setup AWS Amplify?_
You can safely delete the `aws` specific requires and the initialization in the `app.core` namespace.
I plan to split the example code into branches (something like `with-amplify` and `with-storybook`) shortly.
